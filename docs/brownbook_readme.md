This is the documentation site for PooPyLab, an open source simulation software
for wastewater treatment. It is meant to present the ideas behind the
development of the underlying classes, functions, and routines.

Many aspects of PooPyLab, including its documentation shown here, are still
being actively updated and revised.

Not having a background in software engineering has created lots of challenges
for me during the development of PooPyLab. And honestly, I am not the most
brilliant when it comes to mathematics. Hopefully, the documentation explains
why things have been done in specific ways so that you may be able to offer
better solutions and contribute to the project.

Please see the code on [github](https://github.com/toogad/poopylab_project),
with the high level development thoughts also on its wiki.
