#  This is a parser for the Monod terms in the PooPyLab model matrix.
#
#  The goals are:
#    1) Strip the potential Monod (or inhibition) terms;
#    2) Confirm the Monod/inhibition terms by checking their nominators and denominators;
#    3) Create a function call to calculate each Monod/inhibition term, store each result into a list
#    4) Create a dictionary to store the Monod/inhibition term and their "index" in the list in 3)
