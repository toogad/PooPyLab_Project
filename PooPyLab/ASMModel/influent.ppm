Influent is essentially a Pipe.

It provides the definitions of flows and concentrations.

The inlet is NOT to be defined, only the main outlet will be used to supply
information to the receiving unit.

straightly define the main outlet flows and concentrations as known.
build in fractionations for cod, n, p, s, etc.
