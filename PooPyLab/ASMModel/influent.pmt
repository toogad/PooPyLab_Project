Influent is essentially a Pipe.

It provides the definitions of flows and concentrations.

The inlet is NOT to be defined, only the main outlet will be used to supply
information to the receiving unit.

straightly define the main outlet flows and concentrations as known.
build in fractionations for cod, n, p, s, etc.

For a steady state simulation, define the influent condition in this file.
For a dynamic simulation, the influent condition will be save in a separate
.csv file, whose filename is stored in this model file.
