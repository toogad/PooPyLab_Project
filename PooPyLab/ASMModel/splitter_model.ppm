#FLOW_DATA_SRC: IN=UPS MO=UPS SO=PRG
MO = IN - SO

#FLOW_DATA_SRC: IN=UPS MO=PRG SO=DNS
MO = IN - SO

#FLOW_DATA_SRC: IN=DNS MO=DNS SO=PRG
IN = MO + SO


All the above, the equation is written as
 0 = IN - MO - SO

 All three (3) sets of flows are to be solved for the splitter itself.
 The individual branch (outlet) will get its flow data according to its
 data source flag.

 For a splitter unit, its side outlet shall be defined if the splitter
 is NOT a SRT Controller. But if the splitter controls the SRT by
 connecting to a "pipe-WAS" structure, the side outlet flow is still
 considered defined by the program (PRG) runtime.

 Therefore, the FLOW_DATA_SRC for a splitter's side outlet can only
 be PRG (user defined or program runtime) onced it is defined.

 If FLOW_DATA_SRC for the main outlet is PRG or DNS, it shall be
 assigned such ways.
