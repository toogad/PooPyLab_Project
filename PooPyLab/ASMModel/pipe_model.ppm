Flow Balance:
 0 = IN - MO
 0 = IN - Sum(all dischargers' contribution)


Mass Balance:
 Flow data source for the main outlet can be UPS, DNS, and PRG (e.g. pipe-->WAS).
 Assign the main outlet flow as needed.
 Sum up the dischargers contributions.

 Concentrations would be assigned from inlet (flow weighted averages) 
 to the main and side outlets.
