# The purpose of partitioning a PFD is to find the groups of units which must
# be solved together, with as fewest number of units as possible. The algorithm
# was developed by Sargent and Westerberg (1964):
#   It traces from one unit to the next through the unit output streams,
#   forming a "string" of units. This tracing continues until:
#       a) A unit in the string re-appears; or
#       b) A unit or group of units with no more output is encountered.
#
#   1. Select a unit/group
#   2. Trace outputs downstream until
#       2a. a unit or a group on the path reappears 
#           --> Go to Step 3;
#       2b. a unit or a group reached with no external
#           outputs --> Go to Step 4.
#   3. Label all units into a group. --> Go to Step 2.
#   4. Delete the unit or group. Record it in a list. --> Go to Step 2
#   5. Calculation Sequence is from the bottom to top of list.
#
#   Later I abandoned the SW1964 algorithm above because it is complicated
#   in implementation and not the best in terms of speed. Instead, the graph
#   algorithm for finding Strongly Connected Components (SCC) was adopted.
#
#   Preliminary results showed that the SCC algorithm produced results that
#   included the loops identified by the S&W algoritm. However, there was an
#   unwanted SCC included in the result. I am thinking it might have to do with
#   how the Splitter was implemented.
#
#   As of June 24,2015, the Splitter class was updated so that there is
#   no Branch class in the sidestream. The main- and sidestream are now
#   implemented in the same way.
#
#   June 26, 2015, duplicates were eliminated from the results. No matter how
#   the WWTP list was constructed, the SCC algorithm always finds a unique
#   answer for the same process flow diagram (i.e. flowsheet).
#
#   The functions needed are _GetFinishTime(), _SCC_(), _FindSCC_(), and
#   FindGroups()
